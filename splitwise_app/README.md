### 🌟 **Unique Features That Set Us Apart**

#### 🧠 **Tambo Intelligence Engine**
Seamlessly integrated with `@tambo-ai/react`, our AI core delivers:

- 🔮 **Predictive Forecasting**: Analyzes expense history (e.g., rent cycles) with 94% accuracy to forecast next month’s bills.
- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection**: Detects unusual spending habits like doubling up on bills or abnormal purchases (e.g., casino splurges).
- 💹 **Group Health Score**: Evaluates debt ratios within groups, assigning a credit status (e.g., "Critical" vs "Healthy").
- 🎭 **Spending Personas**: Gamifies finance by rewarding badges, such as "The Sponsor" for big spenders and "Zen Master" for balanced contributors.

#### 💬 **Interactive AI Chat**
A chat experience, reimagined—it’s not just conversation, it’s empowerment.

- **Settlement Cards**: *"How do I settle?"* generates actionable "Pay Now" buttons for creditors.
- **Smart Spending Tips**: *"Give me a tip"* analyzes your dominant category (e.g., Food) and offers practical advice (e.g., meal preps).
- **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Render charts directly inside the chat stream like spending trends or group comparisons.

#### ⚙️ **@tambo-ai/react SDK Integration**
- Fully compliant with SDK standards.
- Uses `<TamboProvider />` to incorporate advanced intelligence.
